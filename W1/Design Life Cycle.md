Q: Which are the three stages of the "Design Life Cycle," in what order are they typically performed?
A: Design -> Implementation -> Evaluation.

Q: At which of these stages does one start?
A: It not always start with design, may start with implementation or evaluation.

Q: Why an Interface Design Process?
A: 
• to avoid user frustration with the finished product
• to avoid unnecessary costs during product development
• to avoid additional costs after product development

Q: What is the reasons for going over budget?
A: 
– user-requested changes
– overlooked tasks
– users did not understand their own requirements
– insufficient user-developer communication and understanding

## Foundations for designing interfaces
- Task-centered system design
Understanding users and their tasks.
• how to develop task examples
• how to evaluate designs through a task-centered walk-through

- User-centered design and prototyping
Designing with the user.
• methods for designing with the user
• low and medium fidelity prototyping

- Evaluation
Evaluating interfaces with users
• the role of evaluation in interface design
• how to observe people using systems to detect interface problems

# User-Centered Design
## User-Centered Design
• design is based upon a user’s
– abilities and real needs
– context
– work
– tasks
– need for a usable and useful product

## User-Centered System Design
• is an iterative process that focuses on an understanding of the users and their context in all stages of design and development.
• is based on understanding the domain of work or play in which people are engaged and in which they interact with computers.

assumptions:
– the result of a good design is a satisfied customer.
– the process of design is a collaboration between designers and customers.
– the design evolves and adapts to the user’s changing concerns, and the process produces a specification as an important byproduct.
– the customer and designer are in constant communication during the entire process.

## Participatory Design
The end user should be involved in the design to help the designer understand the requirements and make the design better.

Q: Name at least two advantages and two disadvantages of participatory design.
A:
Advantages :
– users excellent at reacting to suggested system designs
   • designs must be concrete and visible
– users bring in important “folk” knowledge of work context
   • knowledge may otherwise be inaccessible to design team
– greater buy-in for the system often results

Disadvantages:
– hard to get a good pool of end users (to participate)
   • expensive, reluctance, etc.
– users are not expert designers
   • don’t expect them to come up with design ideas from scratch
– the user is not always right
   • don’t expect them to know what they want

## User Involvement
Q: List four ways of involving the user when employing a user-centered focus to system design.
A:
• at the very least, talk to users
it is surprising how many designers don’t …

• contextual interviews & on-site visits
– interview users in their workplace, as they are doing their job
– discover the user’s culture, requirements, expectations, …

• explain your designs
– describe what you are going to do
– get input at all design stages
– all designs are subject to revision by users

• have visuals and/or demos
– people react far differently compared to verbal explanations
– thus, prototypes are critical
– type of prototype matters: sketchy for early design phases later more pronounced/developed/precise

## Sketching and Prototyping
1. sketches
– initial ideas, very fast, very low cost, no interactivity, many different variants can be explored
2. low fidelity prototypes
– fewer variants explored further, still fast and low cost, some interactivity can be simulated
3. medium fidelity prototypes
– more functionality is simulated to test refined concepts
4. high fidelity prototypes
– field testing of the refined designs, more expensive
5. final design

• from design to evaluation
– interface design (idea generation) progresses to usability testing (idea debugging and refinement)

### Sketches
Paper mock-up of the interface’s functionality, look, and feel → quick & cheap to prepare and modify
– drawing of the outward appearance of intended system
– crudity means people concentrate on high-level concepts
– deliberately ambiguous & abstract, leaving “holes” for imagination
– harder to envision a dialog’s progression

• purpose
– brainstorm competing representations
– elicit user reactions
– elicit user modifications/suggestions

Sketching is not about drawing; it is about design.

• Sketching is a tool to help you:
– express
– develop, and
– communicate design ideas

• Sketching is part of a process:
– idea generation
– design elaboration
– design choices
– engineering

• Sketches should include annotations: 
Annotations explain what is going on in each part of sketch & how.

#### Sketch Attributes

• quick
– to make

• timely
– provided when needed

• disposable
– investment in concept, not in execution

• plentiful
– allow to create a series or collection of ideas

• clear vocabulary
– rendering and style indicate that it’s a sketch, and not an implementation

• constrained resolution
– doesn’t inhibit concept exploration

• consistency with state
– refinement of rendering matches the actual state of development of the concept

• suggest & explore rather than confirm
– value lies in suggesting & provoking what could be; i.e., they are the catalyst to conversation and interaction

#### Storyboarding

• series of key frames as sketches
– originally from film; used to get the idea of a scene
– would be talked through

• in interaction (HCI) design:
– a series of (usually) hand-drawn sketches of the interface
– snapshots of the interface at particular points in the interaction
– (can/should) contain annotations of what happens

• Purpose of storyboards in HCI
– to pitch ideas for a user interface to developers or possible users
– users can evaluate quickly the direction in which the interface is heading
– they can serve as a reference for the development

### Low / Medium / High fidelity prototypes
#### Low fidelity prototype
• Low fidelity prototype with paper mockups
• Goal: get feedback from users early with very low cost interactive prototype of envisioned interaction design

##### Paper prototyping
Use paper or sticky notes to simulate interactions.
Paper prototyping is a example of low fidelity prototype.

##### Low-Fidelity Prototypes: Advantages and Problems

Q: a), what are examples for low-fidelity prototypes (>= two)?

b), what are the advantages of low-fidelity prototypes?

c), what are the disadvantages of low fidelity prototypes?



A: a) Paper prototypes, Sketch.

b) 

• takes between only minutes to just a few hours
• does not require “real implementation”
• no expensive equipment needed
• can test multiple alternatives, fast iterations
• almost all interaction can be faked

c)

• human-simulated “computer” inherently buggy
• slow interaction compared to real application; timings not accurate
• difficult to implements some interaction (e.g., pull-downs, feedback, dragging, visualization, etc.)
• looks different from final product; elements sometimes difficult to recognize
• end-users cannot use it by themselves: not in the context of the user’s work environment



#### Medium-Fidelity Prototypes
prototyping with a computer:
– simulate some but not all features of the interface
– engaging for end users

purpose:
– provides sophisticated but limited scenario for the end user to try
– can test more subtle design issues

dangers:
– users’ reactions often “in the small”
– users reluctant to challenge designers
– users reluctant to touch the design
– management may think it is real!



#### High-Fidelity Prototypes
prototyping with (still simple) computer programs, (complex) scripted simulations, interface builders, physical interface builders.



Q: a), what are examples for high-fidelity prototypes (>= two)?

b), what are the advantages of high-fidelity prototypes?

c), what are the disadvantages of high-fidelity prototypes?



A: a) Computer programs, Interface builders.

b)

– more the final look-and-feel
– more functionality
– can test things in detail, engaging for end users

c)

– more effort
– less likely to get major changes
– constrained to selected (programming) tools



#### Limiting Prototype Functionality
• vertical prototypes
– include in-depth functionality for a few selected features
– common design ideas can be tested in-depth

• horizontal prototypes
– the entire surface interface without underlying functionality
– a simulation; no real work can be performed

• scenario
– scripts of particular fixed uses of the system

#### Integrating Prototypes and Final Products
• throw-away
– prototype only serves to elicit user reaction
– prototype creation must be rapid, otherwise will be too expensive

• incremental
– product built as separate components (modules)
– each component prototyped and tested, then added to the final system

• evolutionary
– prototype altered to incorporate design changes
– prototype eventually becomes the final product



#### Approaches: Scripted Simulations and Wizard of Oz
Wizard of Oz:
let human simulates the system’s response.
